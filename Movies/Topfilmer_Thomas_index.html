   I Am Legend is a 2007 American post-apocalyptic horror</br>
   film directed by Francis Lawrence and starring Will Smith, </br>
   who plays US Army virologist Robert Neville. The story is </br>
   set in New York City after a virus, which was originally </br>
   created to cure cancer, has wiped out most of mankind, leaving </br>
   Neville as the last human in New York, other than nocturnal </br>
   mutants. Neville is immune to the virus and he works to develop </br>
   a cure while defending himself against the hostile mutants. </br>
   </br>
	Warner Bros. began developing I Am Legend in 1994, and various </br>
	actors and directors were attached to the project, though production</br>
 was delayed due to budgetary concerns related to the script. Production</br>
 began in 2006 in New York City, filming mainly on location in the city,</br>
 including a $5 million scene at the Brooklyn Bridge. 
 </br>
 </br>
 It is the third feature-film adaptation of Richard</br>
 Matheson's 1954 I Am Legend novel, following 1964's</br>
 The Last Man on Earth and 1971's The Omega Man.</br>
I Am Legend was released on December 14, 2007, in the United States</br>
 and Canada, and opened to the largest ever box office</br>
 (not adjusted for inflation) for a non-Christmas film released </br>
 in the U.S. in December. The film was the seventh-highest grossing</br>
 film of 2007, earning $256 million domestically and $329 million </br>
 internationally, for a total of $585 million.

The Hurt Locker is a 2008 American war film about an Iraq War Explosive </br>
 Ordinance Disposal team who are being targeted by insurgents with booby</br>
 traps, remote control detonations and ambushes. Directed by Kathryn Bigelow,</br>
 it received critical acclaim and won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture.</br>
</br>
 Bigelow won the award for Best Director; as of 2016,</br>
 The Hurt Lockeris the sole film by a female director to</br>
 win in either category. It is also the lowest-grossing</br>
 Best Picture winner in history.</br>
</br>
The Hurt Locker shows soldiers' varying psychological reactions</br>
 to the stress of combat, which though intolerable to some,</br>
 is addictive to others. The story unfolds after a staff sergeant</br>
 is killed by an insurgent trap and an apparently calm veteran</br>
 is brought in to head the squad. His comrades suspect that their</br>
 new team leader is being driven to take terrifying risks. </br>
 </br>
 Writer Mark Boal drew on his experience during embedded access </br>
 to provide an authentic background for the production, although</br>
 certain army procedures were portrayed with artistic licence.

      Avatar (marketed as James Cameron's Avatar) is a 2009</br> 
	  American epic science fiction film directed, written, produced,</br>
	  and co-edited by James Cameron, and starring Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana,</br>
	  Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, and Sigourney Weaver.</br>
</br>
	  The film is set in the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora,</br>
	  a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system,</br>
	  in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor.</br>
	  The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of</br>
	  a local tribe of Na'vi – a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. </br>
	  The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body with the mind</br>
	  of a remotely located human that is used to interact with the natives of Pandora.</br>
</br>
	  Development of Avatar began in 1994, when Cameron wrote an 80-page</br>
	  treatment for the film. Filming was supposed to take place after the</br>
	  completion of Cameron's 1997 film Titanic, for a planned release in 1999,</br>
	  but according to Cameron, the necessary technology was not yet available </br>
	  to achieve his vision of the film. Work on the language of the film's</br>
	  extraterrestrial beings began in 2005, and Cameron began developing the</br>
	  screenplay and fictional universe in early 2006. </br>
	  Avatar was officially budgeted at $237 million. Other estimates put the cost</br>
	  between $280 million and $310 million for production and at $150 million for promotion.</br>
</br>
	  The film made extensive use of new motion capture filming techniques, and was</br>
	  released for traditional viewing, 3D viewing (using the RealD 3D, Dolby</br>
	  3D, XpanD 3D, and IMAX 3D formats), and for "4D" experiences in select South Korean theaters.</br>
	  The stereoscopic filmmaking was touted as a breakthrough in cinematic technology.</br>
	  </br>
	  Avatar premiered in London on December 10, 2009, and was internationally</br>
	  released on December 16 and in the United States and Canada on December 18,</br>
	  to positive critical reviews, with critics highly praising its groundbreaking</br>
	  visual effects. During its theatrical run, the film broke several box office</br>
	  records and became the highest-grossing film of all time, as well as in the</br>
	  United States and Canada, surpassing Titanic, which had held those records</br>
	  for twelve years (and was also directed by Cameron).</br>
	  It also became the first film to gross more than $2 billion and the</br>
	  best-selling film of 2010 in the United States.</br>
</br>
	  Avatar was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director,</br>
	  and won three, for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects.</br>
	  Following the film's success, Cameron signed with 20th Century Fox </br>
	  to produce three sequels, making Avatar the first of a planned tetralogy. </br>
	  On April 14, 2016, Cameron confirmed that there are now plans for four sequels.</br>
	  Avatar 2 is scheduled for release in December 2018, with the sequels following </br>
	  in December 2020, 2022, and 2023, respectively.

      Creed is a 2015 American sports drama film, directed by Ryan Coogler and </br>

	  The film reunites Jordan with Fruitvale Station writer/director Coogler,</br>
	  and Wood Harris, with whom Jordan worked on The Wire.</br>

	Rocky's hometown. Creed was released in the United States on November 25, 2015,</br>
	the fortieth anniversary of the date of the opening scene in 1976's Rocky.</br>
	The seventh installment of the series and sequel to 2006's Rocky Balboa,</br>
	the film received acclaim from critics, who called it the best Rocky film in many years. </br>
	For his performance, Stallone was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor,</br>
	his first Oscar nomination since the original film. He won the National Board of Review Award</br>
	for Best Supporting Actor, Critics' Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor and Golden </br>
	Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture, his first Golden Globe.
